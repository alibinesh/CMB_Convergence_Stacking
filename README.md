The final_codes folder contains the codes required to stack on CMASS galaxies.
In this folder, Final_C2(FiltPixStack) is the latest and best code used for this stacking. 
Final_C2(Random_stack) creates null_maps to ensure the stacking process is working properly.

The different Final_Letter codes are earlier attempts of stacking. They use different methods to stack.


The Void_stacking folder contains codes required to stack on Void locations.
Final_Void.py is the code used to stack voids.


All the other codes in the folders contain the functions used in the Final codes so they do not need to be editted unless you would like to change what those functions do.

The CMB data is obtained from https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/actpol_lensing_maps_get.cfm
